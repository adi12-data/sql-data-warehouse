## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate how to build a full-scale data warehouse using **SQL Server**. It includes scripts for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows, data modeling (star/snowflake schemas or other), and examples of analytic queries. The intent is to provide a reference / starter kit for people building data warehouses with typical data-engineering practices.

---

## Features

- ETL pipelines for ingesting & transforming data  
- Data modeling to support reporting & analytics  
- Sample datasets to work with  
- Scripts to build schema, load data, apply transformations  
- Unit tests / example tests for data integrity

Setup

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/adi12-data/sql-data-warehouse.git


Navigate to the folder:

cd sql-data-warehouse


Load sample datasets (if any) into a designated staging schema or database.

Run schema creation scripts in scripts/ to generate the warehouse structure.

Run transformations / ETL scripts to process staging data into the analytic model.
