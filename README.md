## 🔎 Overview

This project demonstrates how to design and build a **full-scale data warehouse** using **SQL Server**.  

It covers:  
- **ETL workflows** (Extract, Transform, Load)  
- **Data modeling** (star & snowflake schemas)  
- **Analytic queries** for business intelligence  

The goal is to provide a **starter kit/reference project** for anyone interested in learning **data warehousing and SQL-based data engineering practices**.
